# Harmony Next

Pull the top of the queue and act on it (agent-model §5: *pick up the highest-priority next thing and
start the appropriate activity*). One ticket can be named explicitly (`/harmony-plugin:harmony-next B-301`)
or left blank to take the highest-priority awaiting item.

## Flow

### 1. Resolve mode + the target item

Call `mcp__harmony__get_project`; if `mode !== 'opinionated'`, stop (manual-mode projects don't use the
queue). If the user named a ticket, `mcp__harmony__get_task({ task_id })`. Otherwise
`mcp__harmony__query_tasks({ awaiting_human_input: true, sort_by: 'priority', limit: 1 })` and take the
single result. If the queue is empty, say so and stop.

### 2. Show the brief

Call `mcp__harmony__get_brief({ task_id })` and display the rendered `content` blob **verbatim** in a
fenced block (it is already BLUF-formatted and lint-clean — do not re-summarise it). Note the
`iteration` if > 1.

### 3. Resolve by command — but `accept` is only inline for the PURE gates

**Critical (review F1):** P3's `resolve_brief` does exactly three things on accept — promote the
referenced decision, advance state via `pending_activity`, clear the flag. It does **no skill-side work.**
For three gates the *real* work (create children / merge+deploy / observe production) lives **outside**
`resolve_brief`, so resolving inline here would flip state while the ticket's reality lags. So:

- **defer** (any reason) → **deferral is knowledge** (knowledge-discipline.md §"Deferral is knowledge"):
  before parking, author the deferral so the "not now" outlives the ticket (knowledge-model-v1 §5a) —
  ```
  const deferral = mcp__harmony__record_decision({
    type: 'deferral', title: '<ticket>: deferred — <why>',
    content: '<rationale: what we are not doing now + the condition/date to revisit>',
    review_by: '<watch/revisit date, ISO>', domain: [ /* the domain(s) it touches */ ],
    source_type: 'manual', source_activity: 'defer', source_task_id: '<task uuid>',
  })
  mcp__harmony__reference_knowledge({ task_id, decision_id: deferral.id })
  mcp__harmony__resolve_brief({ task_id, command: 'defer', detail: '<reason>' })   // → Parked
  ```
  **Fallback (B-352):** a defer with no rationale still parks — prompt once for the rationale, but if the
  human declines, skip the `record_decision`/`reference_knowledge` and just `resolve_brief({ command:
  'defer' })`. Always safe inline (no external side-effect). (The web `defer`, P5, is mechanical-only and
  never authors this entry — the documented v1 asymmetry.)
  - **Exception — a `stale-patch-review` brief:** `defer` here is **reject / knowing-divergence**, not park
    (see the Stale bullet below + `harmony-stale-patch`). Do NOT author a `deferral` entry for it;
    `resolve_brief` clears Stale and records the divergence.
- **expand** / **related** → read `expand_sections` / `related` from `get_brief` and show them
  (pre-generated; no recompute). Inline.
- **accept** → branch on `awaiting_human_reason`:
  - **Pure gates** — `clarification-draft`, `design-decision-draft`, `plan-draft` (accept ==
    `resolve_brief` with no external side-effect) → resolve inline:
    `mcp__harmony__resolve_brief({ task_id, command: 'accept' })`; report the new `workflow_state`.
  - **Side-effecting gates** — `decomposition-proposal` (children must be created first),
    `release-decision-pending` (merge + deploy), `verification-ack-pending` (production observation) →
    **do NOT call `resolve_brief` here.** Delegate `accept` to the owning skill (step 4), which performs
    the work AND resolves in the correct order.
- **edit** / **iterate** → generative work owned by the gate skill → delegate (step 4); it re-composes
  the brief in place (bumping `iteration`).
- A **Stale** ticket (from the `stale` read, no brief yet) → **delegate to the patch author**: invoke
  `/harmony-plugin:harmony-stale-patch <ticket>` (it reads `stale_ref` + the ticket's referenced knowledge,
  drafts a concrete proposed patch, and composes a `stale-patch-review` brief). Then resolve **per that
  brief**: **accept** applies the patch (P3's extended `resolve_brief` clears the Stale flag, and backflows
  state if the patch carried a `revising-*` `pending_activity`); **defer** rejects it as a knowing-divergence
  (clears Stale, records it, does NOT park). If the ticket *already* has a `stale-patch-review` brief (the
  author ran earlier — it shows in both the `awaiting_human_input` and `stale` reads, de-dup by id), show the
  brief and resolve inline without re-invoking the author.

### 4. Routing table (used for `accept`-delegation on side-effecting gates AND for edit/iterate)

| `awaiting_human_reason` | accept is… | Hand off to |
|---|---|---|
| `clarification-draft` | inline `resolve_brief` | `/harmony-plugin:harmony-clarify <ticket>` (edit/iterate) |
| `design-decision-draft` | inline `resolve_brief` | `/harmony-plugin:harmony-design-decide <ticket> --track <sub-track>` |
| `plan-draft` | inline `resolve_brief` | `/harmony-plugin:start-work <ticket>` |
| `decomposition-proposal` | **delegated** (creates children, then resolves) | `/harmony-plugin:harmony-decompose <ticket>` |
| `release-decision-pending` | **delegated** (merge+deploy, then advances) | `/harmony-plugin:finish-work <ticket>` |
| `verification-ack-pending` | **delegated** (observe prod, then resolves) | `/harmony-plugin:finish-work <ticket>` (verify step) |
| (Stale) | **delegated** — draft the patch, then resolve per the brief (accept applies / defer = knowing-divergence) | `/harmony-plugin:harmony-stale-patch <ticket>` |

### 5. Confirm the outcome

After resolving, report the new state and (if anything new is now awaiting) suggest running the skill
again. Never commit code or edit files from this skill — those are build/release activities.
